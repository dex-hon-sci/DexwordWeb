    I am passionate about using data to solve complex problems.
    My academic pursuit in Astrophysics provided me with valuable skill sets that are immediately useful in data science.
    I am particularly proficient in Statistical Analysis, image processing, and scientific writing.
    Most importantly, I can learn new skills quickly and work in a team setting in any collaborative effort.
    Furthermore, being an expatriate my whole life (I am born Malaysian and raised in Hong Kong) has fostered important interpersonal skills for me.
    Having worked in three countries (China, Finland, and Australia) since 2012, I have learnt the value of communication and intercultural collaboration.
    I am eager to apply my scientific skills to tackle real-life problems and deliver data-driven solutions to empower decision-making in the tech industry.
